# Fork of AHF

Add anisotropic factors (ratios of anisotropic scale factors to the global
isotropic scale factor), to work with tidal simulations.

Note that the current modification has only changed the calculation of
Euclidean distance on position variables to code located in `src/`.
The velocity and potential parts are not supposed to work.
